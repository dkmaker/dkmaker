# 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Pedersen (DKMaker)
Previously ZenturaCP - Changed to reflect my personal account separate from Zentura work activities

## 🚀 About Me
I work as a CTO at Zentura A/S, where I'm passionate about leveraging AI in software development. My preferred development environment combines VSCode with cutting-edge AI tools like Cline and Aider Chat. I specialize in Azure-based solutions and have a keen interest in developing tools that enhance developer productivity.

## 🛠️ MCP Servers
I've developed several Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that help streamline daily development tasks:

### My Custom MCP Servers
- 🌐 [mcp-rest-api](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-rest-api) - A TypeScript-based MCP server for testing REST APIs through Cline
- 🗄️ [mcp-azure-tablestorage](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-azure-tablestorage) - A MCP Server for querying Azure Table Storage during local development
- 🧪 [mcp-function-app-tester](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-function-app-tester) - A MCP Server for testing local Azure Function App APIs
- 🔍 [mcp-tavily-server](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-tavily-server) - Tavily MCP Server for Cline
- 🤖 [mcp-perplexity-server](https://github.com/dkmaker/mcp-perplexity-server) - Perplexity MCP Server for Cline

For more MCP servers and resources, check out the [Model Context Protocol servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) and the [Glama.ai MCP servers](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers) - an all-in-one AI workspace that provides standardized tools, resources, and templates for AI model interactions across various services.
